# NIEM 6.0

This is the NIEM 6.0 major release.

In a major version, content may be updated in any namespace, including Core. Changes may also be made to the NIEM architecture, which may be reflected in the structure and layout of the NIEM schemas.

## Key changes

The following is a summary of the key changes made in this release.  More details are available from the [6.0 issues list](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/labels/6.0) in the NIEM Model issue tracker, and the change log spreadsheet in the release package.

### Naming and Design Rules (NDR) 6.0 updates

The following are the key changes made to the model based on updates to the NDR.

#### Updated namespace URIs ([niemopen/niem-model#25](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/25))

NIEM is now an OASIS Open Project.  URIs for each namespace have been updated to follow the [OASIS Naming Directives, XML Namespace Identifiers and Namespace Documents](http://docs.oasis-open.org/specGuidelines/ndr/namingDirectives.html#xml-namespaces).

```xml
<!-- URI for NIEM Core from 5.2 -->
<xs:schema targetNamespace="http://release.niem.gov/niem/niem-core/5.0/" ...>

<!-- URI for NIEM Core for 6.0 -->
<xs:schema targetNamespace="https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/niem-core/6.0/" ...>
```

#### Harmonized StudentType ([niemopen/niem-model#52](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/52))

The Human Services domain and the Learning and Development domain both define type `StudentType`.  Created a new `nc:StudentType` in Core and converted the two domain types to augmentations so student properties from either domain can be used together under the same Core object.

Merged and moved the only overlapping property (`hs:StudentIdentification` / `lrn-dev:StudentID`) into Core as `nc:StudentIdentification`.
